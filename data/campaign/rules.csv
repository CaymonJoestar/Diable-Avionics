The comm link closes and the display goes black.

A security team enters the Virtuous. On the tactical display, you see the doors open to the bridge autonomously, where a mess of hanging wires and disconnected life support systems surround a husk of a corpse. The team lead checks its vitals and reports it as deceased.

After another few minutes, the security team clears the Virtuous, with no other signs of life aboard the ship.","cutCommLink:Claim the Virtuous.",
