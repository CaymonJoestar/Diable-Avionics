DIABLE AVIONICS

2.70

[RC3] Fixed Linux-related typo.
[RC2] Fixed issue with the Coanda-class' system that could give unlimited speed when spammed.

 - Added Coanda-class frontline destroyer: A heavy destroyer hull with many small turrets and a medium missile hardpoint to bully smaller ships and distract bigger ones. Has a mixed mobility+defense ship system.
 > This is to the Hayle what the Daze is to the Haze.

 - Removed non built-in Dampened Mounts hullmod.
 - Added a pair of bounties to point the player toward the Virtuous, and the Gulf if you don't have IBBs enabled.



BALANCING:

Massive balance pass that aims to make the Wanzers more usable on regular carriers, buff up a few ships that have been a bit too squishy for a while but also tone down a handful of weapons that have on the other hand crept in power a bit too far.

 * WANZERS overall:
   . Now all have default rebuild times closer to regular wings (around + 10 to 20% longer than regular fighters instead of + 100 to +200%),
   . OP costs have been spread out upward a lot.

 * Wanzer Gantry Hullmod: 
   . Now exclusively built into the Storm, Gust and Pandemonium (and added to the Gulf because why the hell not),
   . Now adds one extra craft to all installed wanzer wings (instead of reducing rebuild times),
   . No longer require "wanzer-exclusive" complements to apply its effect!

 > This is an attempt at finding a new balancing paradigm for Wanzers.
 > Hopefully this will make them more usable outside of Diable ships without relying on the Gantry hullmod crutch to prevent snowballing.
 > At the same time, the Gantry has been turned into a tool to make Wanzers great on select hulls rather than an OP tax to make them usable at all on regular carrier.
 > Thus the Wanzer Gantry hullmod has been removed from several ships.
 > Mix-and-match of Wanzer and non-Wanzer wings is now possible with the Gantry, this should allow more versatility in using cheaper wings to draw fire away from the expensive units.

 - Frost trooper:
   . Covet handgun DPS doubled to 150 from 75 (stat card is also much clearer).
   . Rebuild time reduced to 12s from 26, OP cost unchanged at 8.
 > Now a solid Broadsword replacement with half the kinetic damage potential, but much more HE with the blade attacks.

 - Strife gunner:
   . Removed the Thunderbolt launcher.
   . Rebuild time reduced to 15s from 34, OP cost raised to 12 from 9.
 > There's a fierce competition in the 12OP range, I hope the reduced rebuild-time will make up for the loss of the single Thunderbolt.

 - Hoar bodyguard:
   . Gun damage per shot increased to 140 from 125 (dps of 175 per gun from 156), range increased to 600 from 500.
   . HP reduced to 750 from 950, armor reduced to 75 from 100, speed increased to 250 from 160.
   . Rebuild time reduced to 15s from 30, OP cost unchanged at 10.
 > Should now be a capable interceptor able to defend a wide area against missiles and fighters instead of an escort for big ships.

 - Avalanche shock trooper:
   . Added a two-shot Thunderbolt launcher.
   . Armor increased to 200 from 175, speed reduced to 160 from 175.
   . Main gun no longer has limited ammo, damage per shot increased to 75 from 40 but number of pellets reduced to 6 from 8.
   . Rebuild time reduced to 20s from 38, OP cost raised to 14 from 10.
 > The Avalanche was lacking in bite against armored targets, so it gets the Strife's Thunderbolt missiles to make it the improvement it should have been.
 > It now should be equivalent to a wing of Warthogs but more reliable and versatile.
  
 - Warlust sniper:
   . Main gun is now Kinetic instead of Energy, damage and dps unchanged at 400 et 200 respectively.
   . Added 200 EMP damage per shot.
   . Now has a "fighter" role instead of "support".
   . Rebuild time reduced to 20s from 42, OP cost raised to 16 from 12.
 > Basically, a fighter with a HVD. 
 > It's hard to beat the Broadsword in raw kinetic output (900 dps wing wide, if only for a moment) but between the point defense support and the pin-point accuracy, the Warlust should bring something interesting to the table.

 - Blizzaia grenadier:
   . Cicada grenade launcher ammo removed, dps reduced a bit. 
   . Rebuild time reduced to 25s from 42, OP cost raised to 18 from 15.
 > Removed ammo due to an issue with the new Gantry effect

 - Valiant commando
   . Cull damage-per-shot increased to 100 from 65, firerate reduced to maintain dps.
   . Rebuild time reduced to 18s from 38, OP cost raised to 22 from 14.

 - Zephyr marksman
   . Rebuild time reduced to 20s from 46, OP cost raised to 20 from 13.

 - Raven heavy trooper:
   . Glowtusk range reduced to 500 from 625, ammo removed, DPS increased to 200 from 125,
   . Grave HMG range reduced to 550 from 650, DPS increased to 325 from 260,
   . Rebuild time reduced to 25s from 60, OP cost raised to 26 from 16.
 > Now you won't wait forever for the replacement to be deployed! OP cost might require further increase because that thing is a beast without the ammo limit.


 * SHIPS

   . Hull increased to 2250 points from 1750

 - Versant-class hybrid wanzer:
   . Shield efficiency buffed to 0.8 from 1.

   . Flux capacity increased to 4500 from 4000,

   . Flux capacity increased to 6000 from 5500,
   . Speed increased to 65su/s from 50,

 - Haze-class cruiser:
   . OP amount increased to 175 from 170,
   . Maneuverability slightly increased.

   . Number of decks reduced to 3 from 4.
 > Last update added a 4th deck and it is already gone... But hey, those three with the new Gantry hullmod are worth "6" decks if you use solo wings!


 * WEAPONS:


 - Artassault revolver cannon:
   . Accuracy significantly improved
   . Damage and Flux-per-shot increased to 75 from 60,
   . DPS adjusted to 175 from 150.

   . OP cost reduced to 11 from 13.

   . Burst size increased to 4 from 3,
   . Ammo reduced to 16 from 24,

   . Ammo regen increased to half its burst DPS.
   . OP cost reduced to 20 from 26.

 > It should still be a worthwhile upgrade upon the Mark IX but no longer a massive jump in power with the OP cost as the lone meaningful drawback.

BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS:

 - Added "broken" hullmod to recovered Virtuous, and resolved the crashing issue for deploying it without restoring first.
 - Removed (!) icon next to the Virtuous fleet (and the Gulf one if you don't have IBBs enabled) and added it to the post-battle wreck.
